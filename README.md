A basic single-thread interprocess publish/subscribe example is given in src/basic_publisher and src/basic_subscriber. To run using the default UNIX sockets use:
```
gobyd
```
```
cd build/bin
./basic_publisher
```
```
cd build/bin
./basic_subscriber
```
To configure for TCP or other parameters, use the '-h' flag to see command line options or the '-e' flag to see an example configuration file.
